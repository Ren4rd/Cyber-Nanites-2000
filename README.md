> Have you ever heard of [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)?

CyberNanites2000 is a piece of software allowing you to play with a cellular automaton, and even to create your own !

### Description

CyberNanites2000 is written in Java, and allows you to create and visualize the evolution of a cellular automaton, through a JavaFX graphical interface.

It takes only some minutes to create a new automaton : all you have to do is writing the rules of your automaton in a yaml file. Some examples are included to help you, such as the famous [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
of John Conway.
